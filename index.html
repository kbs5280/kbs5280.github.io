          My flagship project for this year is PreQ&trade;, a LendingTree-style
          web application. It allows a user to enter a single set of
          personal information and receive loan pre-qualification offers
          from four industry-specific lenders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under-the-hood PreQ&trade; validates, sanitizes and formats data for four unique
          APIs, including three REST APIs and a SOAP API. Data is formatted as <span>
          JSON, XML and URLEncoded strings</span> customized for each API. Requests are posted via
          web-standard HTTPS and utilize <span>OAUTH, MTLS, and AES256 bit encryption</span> to
          securely transmit data.
        </p>
        <p>
          The app is built in Salesforce and features a password-protected user interface built
          on Salesforce Sites. The controllers and API services are built in Apex
          and utilize SOQL to perform DML operations on an extensive
          relational database.
        </p>
