        Software developer building well-versioned web applications on the
        <span>Salesforce</span> platform. I build business process enabling enterprise
        applications as well as client-facing applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        My applications expose data including information related to medical patients,
        sales, inventory, and users in intuitive and useful interfaces accessed
        within the company and by our clients.
      </p>
      <p>
        I use <span>Postman, Swagger, SQL, SOQL</span> to build, serve, consume,
        and document <span>REST and SOAP APIs</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        My current projects are built using <span>Apex, SOQL, SQL, Visualforce, HTML,
        Javascript, jQuery and CSS</span>. I utilize the Apex testing framework to
        test applications and employ BDD and TDD in an Agile development process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other projects include work with <span>Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Sinatra,
        ActiveRecord, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, React, Node, Selenium, Jasmine,
        jQuery, and Java</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        This site is built using <span>Sass, Jekyll, Textile, Markdown, Liquid,
        and Ruby.</span>

          My flagship project for this year is PreQ&trade;, a LendingTree-style
          web application. It allows a user to enter a single set of
          personal information and receive loan pre-qualification offers
          from four industry-specific lenders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under-the-hood PreQ&trade; validates, sanitizes and formats data for four unique
          APIs, including three REST APIs and a SOAP API. Data is formatted as <span>
          JSON, XML and URLEncoded strings</span> customized for each API. Requests are posted via
          web-standard HTTPS and utilize <span>OAUTH, MTLS, and AES256 bit encryption</span> to
          securely transmit data.
        </p>
        <p>
          The app is built in Salesforce and features a password-protected user interface built
          on Salesforce Sites. The controllers and API services are built in Apex
          and utilize SOQL to perform DML operations on an extensive
          relational database.
